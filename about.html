    <h1>About Embodied Ayurveda</h1>
    <p>Embodied Ayurveda was created to bring Ayurvedic education to life through travel, hands-on learning, and experiences that stay with you long after you return home. We offer immersive retreats and clinical trainings in inspiring destinations, where students and practitioners can deepen their understanding, build confidence, and reconnect with the heart of this ancient healing tradition.</p>
    <p>This is more than just theory in a textbook. Our programs are designed for people who want to live Ayurveda, who are ready to step out of the online classroom and into real-world practice, guided by experienced teachers in beautiful places that spark curiosity and joy.</p>

        <h2>Our Ethos</h2>
        <p>At Embodied Ayurveda, everything we do is rooted in experience. We don’t just talk about transformation—we create the space for it to unfold naturally, through connection, movement, learning, and beauty. These are the values that guide how we teach, how we travel, and how we show up for our community:</p>

                <h3 class="uppercase">Authenticity</h3>
                <p>We hold a deep respect for the roots of Ayurveda. Everything we teach is grounded in tradition. We work with trusted teachers, focus on foundational principles, and share practices that are both powerful and practical. Because Ayurveda isn’t something to sell; it’s something to embody.</p>
