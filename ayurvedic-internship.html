     <p>Attending an in-person Ayurvedic training was a game changer for me. Being fully immersed in the experience allowed me to truly focus and dedicate myself to the learning process. Dr. Resmi is an incredible teacher—she explains concepts in a way that’s both practical and easy to grasp, always grounding them in real-life examples. The small cohort created a warm, engaging dynamic where it was easy to participate and I felt genuinely seen and supported.</p>

     <p>Learning with DR. Resmi was a deeply grounding experience. Her presence feels truly authentic — nothing is forced, nothing performative. It’s rare to come across someone who lives the wisdom they share. The teachings followed a gurukula-like flow — less like a formal class, more like an unfolding through daily rhythm, observation, and honest conversation.</p>
     <p>Being in Bali added a gentle layer of support — the quiet mornings, the scent of earth after rain, the way nature mirrors the teachings</p>
